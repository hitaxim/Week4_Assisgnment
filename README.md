# Week4_Assisgnment

For a peer-graded assisgnment for Getting and Cleaning Data for Data Science Specification, this repository was created.
Various tasks had to be done to complete it. 
Download the zip from the given link in course. Unzip the data file in R working directory.
Also, download the source code and run the file. One can get tidydata.txt as a output.

The code combined training dataset and test dataset, and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.
The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.

Following were the instructions given in the course:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
